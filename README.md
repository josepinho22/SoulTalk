# SoulTalk – Frontend

## About the Project

**SoulTalk** is a web platform designed to provide a calm, discreet, and non-judgmental space for spiritual reflection and guidance.  
The website explores how digital tools can support faith and personal well-being through an accessible and anonymous experience focused on comfort and simplicity.

This project was developed as a **university group project**, with a strong emphasis on **user experience (UX)**, **interface design**, and ethical handling of sensitive topics.

⚠️ **Important:**  
The **backend (PHP)** is currently **temporarily unavailable**.  
As a result, AI-powered and dynamic features are not functional and are represented only at the interface level.
